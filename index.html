                    <p>.When I say run, run. ...RUN! Oh my word! I can't stand burnt toast. I loathe bus stations. Terrible places. Full of lost luggage and lost souls. Yes, well, it's a brilliant noise. I love that noise. Rest is for the weary, sleep is for the dead. I feel like a hungry man eager for the feast! I need...I need...I need... fish fingers and custard! Well Kangs, I must say, there's no place like home... and this is no place like home. Oh I'm so sorry, Jamie. Why are you pointing your screwdrivers like that? They're scientific instruments, not water pistols. I'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... The best thing about a machine that makes sense is you can very easily make it turn out nonsense. You're a clumsy, ham fisted idiot! There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream; people made of smoke and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace. We've got work to do. Oh, for God's sake! Gallfrey stands! Please just... just see me. Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. Fantastic! You've had this place redecorated, haven't you? Hmm, don't like it. People spend all their time making nice things and then other people come along and break them! Oh, marvellous. You're going to kill me. What a finely tuned response to the situation. Sweet, maybe... Passionate, I suppose... But don't ever mistake that for nice. An unintelligent enemy is far less dangerous than an intelligent one…. Do try and keep out of my way in future and in past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. How can you miss me? I'm easy to find. I'm the guy with two hearts, remember? Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! I reversed the polarity of the neutron flow. Who am I? WHO…AM…I?! Brave heart, Clara. Once upon a time. The end. Dad skills. My personal plan is that a thing will probably happen quite soon. The thing is, Adam, time travel is like visiting Paris. You can't just read the guidebook, you've got to throw yourself in! Eat the food, use the wrong verbs, get charged double and end up kissing complete strangers! Or is that just me? Goodbye, Clara. Ricky, if I was to tell you what I was doing to the controls of my frankly magnificent timeship, would you even begin to understand? Did I? It must be the carrot juice making me colour blind! Your ideas are too narrow and crippled. I am a citizen of the universe and a gentleman to boot.</p>
